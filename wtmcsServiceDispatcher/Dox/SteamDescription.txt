Dispatches Cities: Skylines services.

[h1]Purpose[/h1]

The Central Services Dispatcher dispatches service vehicles and crews for various functions in a City, taking distances between buildings, services and vehicles in account, in order to use service vehices more efficently, with options for limiting by district and finetuning many settings.

[h1]Services[/h1]

Currently, the mod can dispatch garbage trucks, hearses and bulldozers.

Future plans include supporting more services and removing stuck vehicles.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

For most options, this mod is not dependant on overriding game code, which should minimize incompatibilities with other mods.

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]

Some people have observed a problem where hearses go to their target buildings but don't load dead bodies.

[h1]Whatever[/h1]

I made this for myself, and use it. Hopefully it works for others as well, but I make no promises.
I also make no promises about updating or fixing things fast, as that depends on how busy I am with work and other stuff.
