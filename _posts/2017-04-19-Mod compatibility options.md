The mod can now use either it's own code, the games original code, or the currently instanciated code for assigning targets and creating vehicles. The default is to use the currently instanciated code.

This is done to make compatibility with other mods better. See [Compatibility Options]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.current_url }}/OptionsCompatibility.html) for more info.
