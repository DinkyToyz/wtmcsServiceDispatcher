The 1.1 release has a few new features, and lots of adjustment under the hood.

The mod now has better control over assignments and the sending-out of spare vehicles. There is more checks of vehicle status before assigning, in order to lower the risk of confusing the AIs, and the dispatchers tries to take care of stuck vehicles.

## New "services"

Two new invisible services has been added. Invisible services don't actually send out any visible vehicles, but do affect the game.

### Bulldozers

The mod can now do automatic bulldozing of burned down and abandoned buildings.  

### Experimental Recovery Crews

Removal of stuck vehicles is a new feature. The service dispatchers does this for their vehicles, it can also be enabled for all vehicles.

Removal of stuck vehicles other than for the enabled dispatchers is experimental, but seems to work.
