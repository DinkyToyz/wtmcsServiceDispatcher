There is now a [setting in the gui]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.current_url }}/OptionsStandardServices.html) for creating a [custom strategy]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.current_url }}/OptionsStandardServices.html#CustomDispatchStrategy) without having to modify the xml file, which should make it musch easier to use custom strategies.

There also a new [setting]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.current_url }}/OptionsStandardServices.html) which limits which service buildings will be used when range is ignored. This way you can make sure all buildings can be servered sooner or later even if they are out of range for all service buildings, but stil avoid vehicles traveling across the entire map.
