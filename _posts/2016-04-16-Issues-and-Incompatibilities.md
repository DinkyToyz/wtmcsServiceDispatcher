Pages for [incompatibilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Incompatibilities.html), [known issues]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Issues.html) and [errors/logging]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/ErrorsLogging.html) are now permanently linkable so they can be used in the steam descripton.

A side-effect from this is that they are also easy to find through the navigation menu.
