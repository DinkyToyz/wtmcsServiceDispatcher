Instead of trying to cram loads of stuff in the steam description for the mod, I've decided to put documentation and what-nots on a project web site.

I might also post updates, and maybe plans and thoughts, here when I feel like it.

For now, you can read the [documentaion for the current version]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.current_url }}), and possibly for [other versions]({{ site.baseurl}}/docs/versions/) as well.
