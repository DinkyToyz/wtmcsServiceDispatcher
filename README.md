Dispatches Cities: Skylines services.

## Purpose

The Central Services Dispatcher dispatches service vehicles and crews for various functions in a City, taking distances between buildings, services and vehicles in account, in order to use service vehices more efficently, with options for limiting by district and finetuning many settings.

## Services

Currently, the mod can dispatch garbage trucks, hearses, bulldozers and vehicle recovery crews (experimental removal of stuck vehicles).

Future plans include supporting more services, starting with ambulances.

## Whatever

I made this for myself, and use it. Hopefully it works for others as well, but I make no promises.
I also make no promises about updating or fixing things fast, as that depends on how busy I am with work and other stuff.
