The complete documentation site is in the `gh-pages` branch.

The following is from the [steam description](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=512341354).

---------------------------------------------

Dispatches Cities: Skylines services.

## Purpose

The Central Services Dispatcher dispatches service vehicles and crews for various functions in a City, taking distances between buildings, services and vehicles in account, in order to use service vehices more efficently, with options for limiting by range or district and finetuning many settings.

When limiting by range, the [Service Radius Adjuster](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785237088) mod can be used to tune the range of service builings, giving even more control. (It currently, at the time of writing, does not have support for adjusting landfills and incinerators though.)

## Services

Currently, the mod can dispatch garbage trucks, hearses, bulldozers and vehicle recovery crews (removal of stuck vehicles).

Future plans include supporting more services.

## Whatever

I made this for myself, and use it. Hopefully it works for others as well, but I make no promises.
I also make no promises about updating or fixing things fast, as that depends on how busy I am with work and other stuff.
