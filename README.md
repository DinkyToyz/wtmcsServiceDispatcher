# Central Services Dispatcher (WtM)

This is a mod for [Cities: Skylines](http://www.citiesskylines.com/).

The following is from the [steam description](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=512341354).

---------------------------------------------



Dispatches Cities: Skylines services.

## Purpose

The Central Services Dispatcher dispatches service vehicles and crews for various functions in a City, taking distances between buildings, services and vehicles in account, in order to use service vehices more efficently, with options for limiting by district and finetuning many settings.

## Services

Currently, the mod can dispatch garbage trucks, hearses and bulldozers.

Future plans include supporting more services and removing stuck vehicles.

## Documentation

[Documentation](http://dinkytoyz.github.io/wtmcsServiceDispatcher/docs/), and more information, is available at the [mods project site](http://dinkytoyz.github.io/wtmcsServiceDispatcher/).

## Compatibility

For most options, this mod is not dependant on overriding game code, which should minimize incompatibilities with other mods.

## Known Issues

Some people have observed a problem where hearses go to their target buildings but don't load dead bodies.

## Whatever

I made this for myself, and use it. Hopefully it works for others as well, but I make no promises.
I also make no promises about updating or fixing things fast, as that depends on how busy I am with work and other stuff.
