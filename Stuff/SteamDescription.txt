Dispatches Cities: Skylines services.

[h1]Experimental[/h1]

This mod is experimental. It might work, but it also might not. It should not affect saves, but it may well wreak havoc with services while enabled.

[h1]Configuration[/h1]

Which services should be dispatched by Central Services can be configured, as can the dispatch strategy, in the mod options in the content manager (unfortunately the options controls are quite limited, so there's a bunch of sliders without any display of the numeric values for now), or a configuration file.

If no services are set to be dispatch by the mod, it should not affect the game.

At the time of writing, the following dispatch strategies are available:

[b]First first[/b]
All buldings regardless of range.

[b]Forgotten first[/b]
Forgotten buidlings in range, followed by forgotten buildings out of range, buildings in range and finally problematic buildings in or out of range.

[b]In range[/b]
Buildings in range followed by forgotten out of range.

[b]In range first[/b]
Buildings in range followed by problematic buildings in or out of range.

[b]Problematic first[/b]
Problematic buildings in range followed by problematic buildings out of range and finally buildings in range.

[b]Very problematic first[/b]
Problematic buildings in range followed by problematic buildings out of range and finally buildings in range.

[b]Custom[/b]
Custom strategy manually defined in the configuration file.

Services are dispatched based on problem magnitude within the strategy rules.

The config file, wtmcsServiceDispatcher.xml, is stored in the folder "ModConfig" wherever the game points to with <DataLocation.localApplicationData>. On a Windows system that'd usually be some where like "C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\ModConfig".

[h1]Whatever[/h1]

I made this for myself, and use it. Hopefully it works for others as well, but I make no promises.
I also make no promises about updating or fixing things fast, as that depends on how busy I am with work and other stuff.
